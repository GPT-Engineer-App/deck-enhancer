# deck-enhancer

a website, where players of Pokemon Trading card game can enter their deck (list of 60 cards), and the website will then analyze the deck, and make strategic recommendations on how to improve it.
To do this, the website will first use the PokemonTCG API to retrieve all data and info about each individual card in the deck. 
It will then use the API of LimitlessTCG (https://docs.limitlesstcg.com/developer.html) to look at the most successful decks and strategies, and run some sort of analyis. 
The end result will be a data-informed, strategically recommended list of cards to enhance the users deck.
